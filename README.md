Empirical Methods in Finance (Time Series)

Course description: Econometric and statistical techniques commonly used in quantitative finance. Use of estimation application software in exercises to estimate volatility, correlations, stability, regressions, and statistical inference using financial time series.

Topic 1: Time series properties of stock market returns and prices

 Class intro: Forecasting and Finance

 The random walk hypothesis

 Stationarity

 Time-varying volatility and General Least Squares

 Robust standard errors and OLS

Topic 2: Time-dependence and predictability

 ARMA models

 The likelihood function, exact and conditional likelihood estimation

 Predictive regressions, autocorrelation robust standard errors

 The Campbell-Shiller decomposition

 Present value restrictions

 Multivariate analysis: Vector Autoregression (VAR) models, the Kalman Filter

Topic 3: Heteroscedasticity

 Time-varying volatility in the data

 Realized Variance

 ARCH and GARCH models, application to Value-at-Risk

Topic 4: Time series properties of the cross-section of stock returns

 Single- and multifactor models

 Economic factors: Models and data exploration

 Statistical factors: Principal Components Analysis

 Fama-MacBeth regressions and characteristics-based factors
